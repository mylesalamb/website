<p>
This project was my dissertation, submitted as part of my BSc(Hons) degree, this
project required me to investigate the state of ECN (Explicit Congestion
Notification) traversal on the network.
</p>

<p>
Below, I detail the aims and the results from the paper.
</p>

<p>
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) allows devices on the network to signal incipient congestion before
a congestive loss occurs. However, devices on the network have presented deployment
issues for features such as ECN through applying modifications to packets that are destructive to
ECN signalling. My paper investigates where network devices alter ECN Capable Transport
(ECT) code points. To achieve this, I implemented a new network analysis tool. Subsequently
conducting a medium-scale deployment of this tool to gather various measurements from the network 
to ascertain the current state of affairs of the treatment of ECN on the network. 
</p>

<p>
Key findings include that there does not appear to be any particular inhibitors to the deployment of
ECN within Quic (a relatively new transport protocol). Additionally, we find that the transport protocol in use generally does not
influence the behaviour of devices on the network, and that the specific ECT code point in use does not generally cause devices to
misbehave.
