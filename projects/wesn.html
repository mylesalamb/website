title: Where is ECN stripped on the network?
name: wesn
tags: project
short_description: My 4th year university project. A network measurement study involving deploying network analysis tool across 12 hosts around the globe.
languages: Python, C, BASH, HCL (Hashicorp Configuration language)

<p>
This project was my dissertation, submitted as part of my BSc(Hons) degree, this
project required me to investigate the state of ECN (Explicit Congestion
Notification) traversal on the network.
</p>

<p>
Across the duration of this project, I wrote a network analysis tool in C, developed
an experimental methodology to realise the reasearch aims, wrote terraform (IaC) to
define suitable infrastructure to deploy the tool across the globe, as well as a suite
of data analysis tools to recover the statistics about the data obtained.
</p>

<p>
This project was much longer in length than any previous project that I had worked on
and covered numerous areas of the software stack. From interacting with the kernel's
packet buffer, allowing unconstrained interactions with outgoing packets. To defining
suitable cloud infrastructure so that the tool could be deployed in a meaningful and
manageable way.
