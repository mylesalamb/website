<p> 
HTTPoSMS (HTTP over SMS) is a re-hash of a previous project that I had worked on
at a <a href="https://github.com/mylesalamb/iposms">hackathon</a>. Where myself
and a few others attempted to implement a mobile phone browser that was not
constrined by the availability of an internet connection.
</p>

<p>
However, the solution developed at this hackathon was suboptimal for numerous reasons...
<ul>
        <li> 
                The server component utilised twilio, although a decent platform
                for 2FA. It is prohibitavely expensive to use it for tunneling
                HTTP
        </li>
        <li>
                The mobile component, was merely a fork of an existing text-based-browser
                written for an ancient version of android
        </li>
        <li>
                The protocol between client and server (over SMS) was mostly adhoc
                and consequentaially was constrained to a multiple-client to single-server
                model. Where the SMS responses are a bottleneck, this is suboptimal.
        </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To remedy these issues, I decided to rewrite the project from scratch.
planned features for the project are...
<ul>
        <li>A server component written from the ground up in C (and later with MPI), targetting
        Raspberry Pis with GPRS/GSM modules. These can be fitted with standard
        SIM cards with unlimited SMS plans for around Â£4/month (much cheaper)</li>

        <li>A re write of the mobile browser, written for a recent version of android</li>
        <li>The development of a proper standard to alleviate issues
        with the previous implementation (Reordering, SMS loss). As well as catering
        for the potential for parallelism</li>
</ul>
