<p>
An operating system that targets the Raspberry Pi. Currently the operating
system exists as a fairly minimal collection drivers for the hardware that the
Raspberry Pi provides, with an upper half virtual memory mapping.
</p>

<p>
I intend to continue to build out the core features required by an operating system
kernel, using early versions of the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/0.10/source">Linux Kernel (~v0.10)</a> to guide
some of the architectural decisions. As this operating system will realistically
only ever target one architecture (arm64). Within that, two boards/SoC, namely Broadcom's BCM2711 and the QEMU 'virt' board.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I am building out the memory subsytem of the operating system, such as writing a general purpose
memory allocator for the kernel (kmalloc and friends). After finishing this, I will be able to begin building
a filesystem driver to interact with the SD card in a meaningful way
</p>

<p>
Another interesting area that I intend to focus on in the future is to write a driver for a ENC28J60 ethernet controller
so that I can begin to write a networking stack for the operating system.
