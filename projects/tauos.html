An operating system that targets the Raspberry Pi. Currently the operating
system exists as a fairly minimal collection drivers for the hardware that the
Raspberry Pi provides, such as drivers for interacting with the boards mini-uart,
Videocore mailbox property API and Framebuffer.

Im currently working on getting exceptions/interrupts working properly, and building
on some core utilities for the kernel, such as abstractions for the drivers.
