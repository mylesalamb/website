<p>
YASSG (Yet Another Static Site Generator), is a tool that I wrote to generate
my website, as I was unhappy with other offerings that already existed (Pelican, Jekyll).
</p>

<p>
Whilst other SSGs are featureful, all I really needed or preferred was a simple
abstraction over Jinja2, that I could embelish with features as and when I required
them.
</p>

<p>
Since 2021 I have been sporadically adding features and improvements, as and when
they are required by this website, as such the tool is now generally in a usable
state. Which I believe this website attests to.
