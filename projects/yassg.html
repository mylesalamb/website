<p>
YASSG (Yet Another Static Site Generator), is a tool that I wrote to generate
my website as I was unhappy with other offerings that already existed (Pelican, Jekyll).
</p>

<p>
Whilst other SSGs are featureful, all I really needed/preferred was a simple
abstraction over Jinja2, that I could embelish with features as and when I required
them.

<p>
I do plan in the future to continue to extend this project to a point where it
may be useful for other people as well. Although in its current state there are
a few defects that I have not patched, as my workflow simply doesnt require it.
