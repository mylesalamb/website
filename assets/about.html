<h2>General stuff:</h2>

        <dt> <b>Why does this website look like something from the 1970s?</b> </dt>
        <dd>    <p>
                The web development sphere has continually become more and
                more bloated over time, many articles discussing "the web obesity crisis" (ironically on bloated sites)
                have already discussed this, and suggest that text heavy websites will continue to
                grow in size into the range of 5Mb. 
                </p>

                <p>
                This growth in the size of webpages is largely attributed to needless images
                and large, often uneeded Javascript/CSS dependencies (JQuery 3.6.0 == 70.68k).
                Realising this, I wrote this website with an emphasis on minimising bloat. Hence this
                website uses a single, cacheable CSS file and uses a total of <b>0</b> lines of JavaScript, as informational websites
                should not need anything more.
                </p>

        <dt><b>Why write your own SSG?</b></dt>
        <dd>    
                <p>
                Because it's fun! Writing and then using your own software is fairly liberating.
                For instance, other SSGs such as Pelican or Jekyll seem to bludgeon their users
                into their own way of doing things (pre built themes, mandatory layouts, etc...).
                In writing your own SSG you are free to add your own features that support
                how you like to work. For instance, with YASSG (the SSG used for this site)
                I can embed template directives within template content, that will actually be rendered.
                This isnt sometihng that either Jekyll or Pelican support (to my knowledge).
                FYI the recursive expansion is handled
                <a href="https://github.com/mylesalamb/yassg/blob/cd20486196ac8a1e2bd585604995f7ab912e8f63/yassg/template.py#L53-L60">here</a>.                
                </p>

                <p>
                This recursive expansion has interesting implications. for instance, both the <a href="{{ get_object_url('articles.html') }}">articles</a>
                and <a href="{{ get_object_url('projects.html') }}">projects</a> pages use the same underlying template that handles a generic 'listing' of pages
                where the templating engine, passes an argument to itself to derive a list of suitable entries on the page.

        <dd>
                <p>
                Artix Linux(runit), more or less a fork of Arch Linux, that does not
                use the systemd init system. I had previously used Void Linux where I found
                runit to be much simpler.
