                My name is Myles Lamb and I am a Computing Science graduate from the
                University of glasgow. Since graduating Univeristy I have gone on to
                work at Morgan Stanley as a software engineer (specifically a 
        <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/devops-engineer">DevOps
                Engineer</a>)
        </p>

        <p>
                During my time at University, studying for my BSc (Hons) I specialised
                within the Computer Systems segement of the University, selecting courses
                in Operating Systems, Networked Systems, Computer Architecutre, Distributed and Parallel Systems, etc.
                Within my final year of university I wrote my dissertation on a network measurement study that I
                conducted. Focussing on the traversal of ECN markings on IP packets and
                relevant transport layer protocols.

                Outside of work and studies I work on a variety of side projects, such as
                this website, the associated tooling that generates it, and the server
                that I administer that hosts the website. I am additionally working on
                a piece of software for my Raspberry Pi that seeks to tunnell HTTP
                over SMS such that one can browse the internet on their phone with no
                active internet connection, something I had previously experimented with at a
