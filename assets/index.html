        <p>
                My name is Myles Lamb and I am a Computing Science graduate from the
                University of Glasgow. Since graduating University I have gone on to
                work at Morgan Stanley as a Software Engineer (specifically a 
        <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/devops-engineer">DevOps
                Engineer</a>) managing release artefacts such as OCI images, and various
                programming language specific packages.

        <p>
                During my time at University, studying for my BSc (Hons) I specialised
                within the Computer Systems segement of the University, selecting courses
                in Operating Systems, Networked Systems, Computer Architecutre, Distributed and Parallel Systems, etc.
                Within my final year of university I wrote my dissertation on a network measurement study that I
                conducted. Focussing on the traversal of ECN markings on IP packets and
                relevant transport layer protocols.

        <p>
                Outside of work, I develop some pet projects to develop skills
                in areas that interest me. This primarily includes, systems programming
                and systems administration.
        </p>

        <p>
                These interests outside of my work life lead me to develop this
                website. This includes the tooling that generates these webpages from
                templates, as well as managing the server that serves them.
